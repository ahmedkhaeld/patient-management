/**
 * LocalStack - AWS CDK Stack for Local Development Environment
 * 
 * <p>This class defines an AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) stack specifically designed
 * for local development and testing purposes. It leverages the AWS CDK framework to
 * programmatically define cloud infrastructure as code.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Key aspects of this implementation:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Infrastructure as Code:</b> Uses AWS CDK to define AWS resources programmatically
 *       in Java rather than through manual configuration or CloudFormation templates.</li>
 *   <li><b>Local Development Focus:</b> Configured specifically for local development environments,
 *       allowing developers to test AWS service interactions without deploying to the cloud.</li>
 *   <li><b>Bootstrapless Deployment:</b> Uses BootstraplessSynthesizer to avoid requiring
 *       a bootstrapped environment, simplifying local development setup.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>The stack is designed to be synthesized to CloudFormation templates that can be
 * deployed to LocalStack (a local AWS emulator) rather than to actual AWS services,
 * enabling faster development cycles and cost-free testing.</p>

     *   <li>Configures stack properties with a BootstraplessSynthesizer, which allows deployment

     *   <li>Synthesizes the stack into CloudFormation templates in the specified output directory</li>
